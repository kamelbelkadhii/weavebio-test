This code reads an XML file and extracts data from it to create nodes and relationships in a Neo4j graph database. It uses the py2neo library to connect to the database and the xmltodict library to parse the XML file.

The ingest_data function performs the following steps:

-**Reads the contents of the XML file and loads it into a dictionary using xmltodict.**

-**Connects to the Neo4j graph database using the Graph class from py2neo.**

-**Deletes all existing nodes and relationships in the graph.**

-**Creates nodes and relationships for each protein in the XML file.**

-**Creates nodes and relationships for each feature in the XML file.**

-**Creates nodes and relationships for each gene in the XML file.**

-**Creates nodes and relationships for each organism in the XML file.**

-**Creates nodes and relationships for each reference in the XML file.**

The validate_data function is a helper function that checks if a key exists in a dictionary and returns its value if it does, or None if it doesn't.

The code also sets up a scheduler using the apscheduler library to run the ingest_data function every hour in the V1 file.

Below is the graph architecture (There are some displaying issues because of neo4j software.)

I used Airfflow in the file V2, the ingest_data function is used into a PythonOperator and added to a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). The DAG defines the dependencies between tasks and schedule the execution of the DAG at a specific interval. Another approach for refactoring is to use two different PythonOperators: extract_data (E), transform_and_load(TL).


To make the code really scalable, I would consider the following improvements:

Use a configuration file: Instead of hardcoding the file path and Neo4j credentials in the code, we can use a configuration file that can be easily updated. This allows use to reuse the code with different input files and database connections without modifying the code.

Use a data pipeline: Instead of reading the entire XML file into memory and processing it at once, we can use a data pipeline to stream the data and process it in chunks. This is useful when working with very large files that cannot fit into memory.

Use parallel processing: When processing large files, it can be faster to use parallel processing to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores. We can use the multiprocessing module to parallelize the code.

Handle errors gracefully: When working with external data, there is always a risk of encountering errors such as missing fields or invalid data. We can add error handling to the code to log errors and continue processing the rest of the data (Part of this can be solved using Airflow).

Optimize database queries: When working with large datasets, database queries can become a bottleneck. We can optimize the queries by using indexes, constraints, and Cypher queries that leverage Neo4j's graph database capabilities.

Monitor performance: When running the code on a production system, it's important to monitor its performance to detect and fix any issues that may arise.T
his part can also be covered by using Airflow


***How To Run:***

1- install the required libraries by running *pip install -r requirements*

2- Create the Graph Database (I used the docker method mentioned in coding challenge)

3- Connect to the default neo4j (in the script I'm using the following connection details: 
  
  url: bolt://localhost:7687
  
  username: neo4j
  
  password: weavebio)
  
  NOTE: You need to change neo4j password (the default one is neo4j but it won't work

4- run the script using python script-v1.py or script-v2.py (first one using apscheduler and the second one using airflow)
